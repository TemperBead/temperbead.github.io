## License Overview

The Dreamcatcher core dev team recognizes both the lack and inability to currently inact good samaritan laws on the blockchain.There are many legal gaps including but not limited to: Who is liable if a project goes wrong? What are the local juristical implications (i.e. taxes, jurisprudence, etc). This document attempts to lay the foundation of blockchain best practices around basic contract law. 

The DPL is the briefing material to a Legal Professional to generate the Dreamcatcher Public Smart-License (DPL.)

The Dreamcatcher is a blockchain-based Innovation Platform that brings together Talent (workers), Capital (investors), Prior Art (existing tech) and Demand. There is no preferred or authoritative organisation within the Dreamcatcher - and so there is a need to offer to Users a legal template under which they can do business with each other.

The Core DPL is the root of the Licence Stack and is intended to form the foundation of that template. The DPL comes into force between any two Users of the system who have unilaterally “Signed”[1] it. It forms the lowest common denominator (i.e. the core licence P2P connection) for doing business on the Dreamcatcher.

The Core DPL can optionally be extended by the use of Licence Modules which are unilaterally signed and sit on top of Core DPL. If a Module has been independently and unilaterally signed by two parties, it is available to those two parties should they want to do business. I.e. it forms a menu of pre-signed P2P options that can be selected.

Finally, the details of the specific work to be carried out are held in DCM Contracts. DCM Contracts are not signed unilaterally in advance but rather are agreed between two parties before signature. For example they hold the parameters of the work to be carried out, the specific details of the agreement, and deliverables.

See Definitions: License Stack for how these three interact.

The aim is therefore to provide the DPL generally, optionally to provide Modules (of which we have one example - an NDA), and to allow hooks in the legal wording that binds these with DCM Contracts to provide a legal agreement.

The DPL stack is not only captured in code but can be both filtered and condensed into a printable format that can be read by legal professionals and signed by third parties if necessary.

At this stage we’re intending only to provide a core license framework, at the atomic level, that reaches this goal.

As a test case, we have four independent Users of the Dreamcatcher who wish to collaborate on a project, to record each contribution to that project but to leave attribution (division of any benefit) to a future point.

Note that the Core DPL offered here does not have preferential rights over any other framework License Stack offered on the DCM. Any User may construct and offer a License for conducting work on the DCM. The intention however if to make the Core DPL, and the framework it provides through compatible Modules and Contracts, useful to Users of the DCM.
