This is the means by which to introduce external data into the blockchain based system, in a way that does not corrupt the key blockchain property of reproducibility. That is to say, being able to rerun blocks thru different computers and verify that the same answer came out. Side effects are any external event - something that cannot be reproduced - a simple example is receiving an email. The converse is required too - being able to use the pure, clean, secure blockchain based calculations to trigger unreproducible external events.

An example of why the fault finding aspect is useful is that if you call me and say that at roughly 10am something weird happened in the app and you can't seem to make it happen again, we would be able to see the actual interactions the application made and very quickly be able to reproduce the problem, making fixing it much faster, and giving you reassurance that we did actually know what is going on, rather than having to ask you to keep an eye out for it happening again because we can't notice anything amiss."))}m.isMDXComponent=!0},56435:function(e,t,n){t.Z=n.p+"assets/images/mixing-droplet-cc99a7cf93ede713e25b9f9bd1091783.jpg"}}]);
